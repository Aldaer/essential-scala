#+TITLE: Core Scala
* Everything is an object
  - In Scala, everything is an object. We interact with objects by method calls.
** Literals
   - Let's create some objects and interact with them at the REPL.
   - A literal expression is the simplest way to create an object
   - What is a literal? A program that literal stands for the value it creates. E.g. "foo", 2
   - What is an expression? A program that evaluates to a value. Scala is an "expression oriented" language, means most program constructs in Scala are expressions.
   - Examples of literals
** Compound Expressions
** Object Literals
   - Instance variables (val)
   - Methods
     - Methods are expressions (no return)
     - Types declarations and type inference
   - The type of an object
   - Objects are values
** Classes
   - Constructors
   - Classes let us abstract over objects
   - Apply syntax?
   - Companion objects
     - additional constructors
     - apply method and convention as a constructor
     - case classes as formalism of common pattern
   - Functions
* Object-oriented Programming in Scala
** Traits
   - Traits abstract over interface and implementation
** Things that are this or that
   - inheritance, subtyping
   - def vs val in traits / overriding
   - sealed trait, case classes
   - pattern matching
   - final
** Things that are this and that
   - Extending multiple traits
   - Linearization / trait composition
   - Self types
** Things that contain other things
   - Generic types
     - Tuple and option (introduce via examples)
   - Type bounds
   - Generic methods
   - Contra- and co-variance
     - Protip: forget this stuff
* Collections
* Unscheduled Topics
  - var
  - uniform access principle
    - methods of no arguments
  - Value objects?
** Scala's Type System
   - Any and Nothing
   - Object
   - AnyRef and AnyVal
