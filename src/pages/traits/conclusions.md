## Conclusions

In this chapter we have explored two extremely important patterns: **algebraic data types** and **structural recursion**. With the former we can mechanically define a large class of data types. With the latter we can mechanically write programs that process the former. These two tools are among the most commonly used in idiomatic functional code.

In the exercises we developed a few common data structures, but we were limited to storing a fixed type of data, and our code contained a lot of repetition. In the next section we will look at how we can abstract over types and methods, and introduce some important concepts of sequencing operations.
