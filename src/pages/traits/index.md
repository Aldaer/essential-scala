So far we have seen a lot to do with Scala's *classes*. Classes provide us with a way to **abstract over objects** that have similar properties, allowing us to write code that works with any object in a class.

In this section we explore **abstraction over classes**, allowing us to write code that works with objects of different classes.

This section also marks a change in our focus. In previous sections we have primarily addressed the technical aspects of constructing Scala code. In this section our focus will start to change towards using Scala as a **medium to express our thoughts**.
