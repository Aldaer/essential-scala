title: Modelling Data with Objects
---

In the previous chapter we saw how to create literal objects and interact with them via method calls. In this section we're going to see how we can create our own types or **"classes"** of object to abstract over values.

We'll then see how we can abstract over classes using **traits** and other features of Scala. By the end of this chapter we will have an appreciation for the powerful tools Scala gives us to break programs down into their smallest components and build them up in just the right way. We will also understand when to use each technique in writing programs.
