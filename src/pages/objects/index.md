title: Modelling Data with Objects
---

In the previous section we saw how we can create literal objects and interact with them via method calls. In this section we're going to see how we can use templates for objects, called classes, to abstract over literals. We'll then see how we can abstract over classes using traits and other features of Scala. By the end we will have an appreciation for the powerful tools Scala gives us to break programs down into their smallest components and build them up in just the right way. We will also understand when to use each technique in writing programs.
