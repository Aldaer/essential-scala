This book is aimed to programmer learning Scala for the first time. We assume you have some familiarity with an object-oriented programming language such as Java, but little or no experience with functional programming.

Our goal is to describe how to build programs using Scala, and we introduce Scala's features in the context of the problems they solve. We are not aiming for exhaustive coverage of Scala's features, and this text is not a reference manual.

Except for a few exercises we don't rely on any external libraries. You should be able to complete all the problems inside with only a text editor and Scala's REPL, or an IDE such as the [Scala IDE for Eclipse](http://scala-ide.org/) or [IntelliJ IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).

Core Scala was created by [Noel Welsh](http://noelwelsh.com) and [Dave Gurnell](http://davegurnell.com/) of [Underscore](http://underscoreconsulting.com). It was built using [Jekyll docs](https://github.com/untyped/jekyll-docs), plain text, and a deep and profound love of functional programming.
