title: Conclusion
---

We have had a very brief introduction to the fundamentals of Scala:

* expressions, which evaluate to values; and
* objects, which are values.

We've seen how we can write literals for many objects, and use method calls and compound expressions to create new objects from existing ones.

We have still have a long way to go. Next we're going to see how classes provide a template for creating objects, allowing us to reuse code and unify similar objects will a common type.
