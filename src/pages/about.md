title: About Core Scala
---

Core Scala was created by [Noel Welsh](http://noelwelsh.com) and [Dave Gurnell](http://davegurnell.com/) of [Underscore](http://underscoreconsulting.com).

It was built using [Jekyll docs](https://github.com/untyped/jekyll-docs), plain text, and all the love in the world.
